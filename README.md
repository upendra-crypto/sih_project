Of course. Here is a comprehensive `README.md` file designed for a full-stack project, covering both the frontend and the backend.

# Temple & Pilgrimage Crowd Management (Full-Stack)

This is a full-stack solution for the **"Temple & Pilgrimage Crowd Management"** problem statement. It includes a backend API and a frontend user interface to provide a complete system for managing crowds at pilgrimage sites like Somnath, Dwarka, and others.

The system allows pilgrims to book virtual darshan slots, view real-time crowd levels, and raise emergency alerts, while providing administrators with tools to monitor and manage the situation effectively.

## ‚ú® Features

### Backend (API)

  * **Secure Authentication**: User registration and login using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
  * **Virtual Queue System**: Manages booking *darshan* slots to prevent overcrowding.
  * **Real-time Data Ingestion**: Endpoints to receive live crowd data from IoT sensors or AI models.
  * **Emergency Alert System**: A mechanism to log and process panic alerts from users.
  * **Role-Based Access**: Differentiates between pilgrims and administrators.

### Frontend (User Interface)

  * **Pilgrim Dashboard**: A user-friendly interface for pilgrims to manage their bookings and view temple statuses.
  * **Interactive Map**: Displays temple locations with live crowd levels and estimated wait times.
  * **Digital Darshan Pass**: Generates a QR code for each booking that can be scanned at the temple entry.
  * **Admin Panel**: A dedicated dashboard for authorities to monitor crowd density, view active alerts, and manage resources.
  * **Real-time Notifications**: Alerts users about their upcoming booking slots or emergency situations.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

  * **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Mongoose, JWT, bcryptjs
  * **Frontend**: React, Axios (for API communication), a mapping library (like Leaflet), and a UI framework (like Material-UI or Tailwind CSS).

## üìÇ Project Structure

This project uses a monorepo structure, with the backend and frontend code living in separate directories.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get both the backend and frontend running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

  * [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or newer)
  * [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) (running locally or a cloud instance)

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```sh
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd <repository-folder>
    ```

2.  **Set up the Backend:**

      * Navigate to the backend directory.
        ```sh
        cd backend
        ```
      * Install dependencies.
        ```sh
        npm install
        ```
      * Create a `.env` file in the `/backend` directory and add the following:
        ```env
        MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/pilgrimageDB
        JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_key_for_jwt
        PORT=5000
        ```
      * Start the backend server.
        ```sh
        npm start
        ```
      * The backend API will be running on `http://localhost:5000`.

3.  **Set up the Frontend:**

      * **Open a new terminal window.**
      * Navigate to the frontend directory from the project root.
        ```sh
        cd frontend
        ```
      * Install dependencies.
        ```sh
        npm install
        ```
      * Create a `.env` file in the `/frontend` directory. This tells your React app where to find the backend API.
        ```env
        REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
        ```
      * Start the frontend application.
        ```sh
        npm start
        ```
      * The frontend will open in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## üìã API Endpoints

The frontend application communicates with the following backend endpoints.

**Note**: Routes marked with üîí require a valid JWT `token` in the `x-auth-token` header.
